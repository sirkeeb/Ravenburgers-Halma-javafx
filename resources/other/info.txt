Rules of 2-Player Halma

Halma is a strategic board game played on a square board with the objective of moving all of one's pieces into the opponent's starting corner.

- Each player begins with **19** pieces (often represented as pawns or checkers).
- One player starts in the bottom-left corner, and the other in the top-right.
- The goal is to move all pieces into the opponent’s starting corner before they do the same.

**Movement Rules**

- A piece can move **one space** in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- A piece can also **jump** over adjacent pieces (either its own or the opponent's) in a straight line, landing in the next empty space.
- Jumping is optional, but multiple jumps can be chained in a single turn if possible.

**Winning Condition**
- The first player to move all their pieces into the opponent’s starting corner **wins** the game.
- If both players complete their moves in the same turn, the game is a **draw**.

**Strategy Tips**
- Use jumping to move pieces faster across the board.
- Spread out pieces early to create multiple jumping opportunities.
- Block your opponent’s progress while maintaining access to your own destination.
